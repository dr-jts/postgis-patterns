## General

### Find geometries which do NOT intersect/equal another table's
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/162651/looking-for-boolean-intersection-of-small-table-with-huge-table>

Do not use a `JOIN` with `ST_Disjoint` or `NOT ST_Equals`, since that does not use the spatial index.

* Use `NOT EXISTS`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM polygons
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM streets WHERE ST_Intersects(polygons.geom, streets.geom))
```

* Use a `LEFT JOIN ON ST_Intersects/ST_Equals` with `WHERE right-side = NULL`

### Test if two 3D geometries are equal
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/373978/how-to-check-two-3d-geometry-are-equal-in-postgis>

## With Tolerance

### Spatial Equality with Tolerance
Example: <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/176359/tolerance-in-postgis>

This post is about needing `ST_Equals` to have a tolerance to accommodate small differences caused by reprojection
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/141790/postgis-st-equals-false-when-st-intersection-100-of-geometry>

This is about small coordinate differences defeating `ST_Equals`, and using `ST_SnapToGrid` to resolve the problem:
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/56617/st-equals-postgis-problems>

This says that copying geometries to another database causes them to fail `ST_Equals` (not sure why copy would change the geom - perhaps done using WKT?).  Says that using buffer is too slow
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/213240/st-equals-not-matching-with-exact-geometry>

<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/176359/tolerance-in-postgis>

### ST_ClosestPoint does not intersect Line

<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/11510/st-closestpointline-point-does-not-intersect-line>

#### Solution
Use `ST_DWithin`

### Discrepancy between GEOS predicates and PostGIS Intersects
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/259210/how-can-a-point-not-be-within-or-touch-but-still-intersect-a-polygon>

Actually it doesnâ€™t look like there is a discrepancy now.  But still a case where a distance tolerance might clarify things.

## Polygon / Polygon

### Find Polygons not contained by other Polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/185308/find-polygons-that-does-not-contain-any-polygons-with-postgis>

#### Solution
Use the LEFT JOIN on `ST_Contains` with NULL result pattern

### Find non-covered polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/333302/selecting-non-overlapping-polygons-from-a-one-layer-in-postgis>
```sql
WITH
data AS (
    SELECT * FROM (VALUES
        ( 'A', 'POLYGON ((100 200, 200 200, 200 100, 100 100, 100 200))'::geometry ),
        ( 'B', 'POLYGON ((300 200, 400 200, 400 100, 300 100, 300 200))'::geometry ),
        ( 'C', 'POLYGON ((100 400, 200 400, 200 300, 100 300, 100 400))'::geometry ),
        ( 'AA', 'POLYGON ((120 380, 180 380, 180 320, 120 320, 120 380))'::geometry ),
        ( 'BA', 'POLYGON ((110 180, 160 180, 160 130, 110 130, 110 180))'::geometry ),
        ( 'BB', 'POLYGON ((170 130, 190 130, 190 110, 170 110, 170 130))'::geometry ),
        ( 'CA', 'POLYGON ((330 170, 380 170, 380 120, 330 120, 330 170))'::geometry ),
        ( 'AAA', 'POLYGON ((330 170, 380 170, 380 120, 330 120, 330 170))'::geometry ),
        ( 'BAA', 'POLYGON ((121 171, 151 171, 151 141, 121 141, 121 171))'::geometry ),
        ( 'CAA', 'POLYGON ((341 161, 351 161, 351 141, 341 141, 341 161))'::geometry ),
        ( 'CAB', 'POLYGON ((361 151, 371 151, 371 131, 361 131, 361 151))'::geometry )
    ) AS t(id, geom)
)
SELECT a.id
FROM data AS A
LEFT JOIN data AS b ON a.id <> b.id AND ST_CoveredBy(a.geom, b.geom)
WHERE b.geom IS NULL;
```

### Find Polygons NOT covered by union of other Polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/313039/find-what-polygons-are-not-fully-covered-by-union-of-polygons-from-another-layer>

### Find Polygons covered by a set of other polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/212543/compare-row-to-all-others-in-postgis>

#### Solution
For each polygon, compute union of polygons which intersect it, then test if the union covers the polygon

### Improve performance to find Polygons covered by other Polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/404461/best-practice-for-counting-polygons-in-polygons>

`pop` represents populated areas and it contains about 30k of polygons. 
`polys` is smaller polygons with about 120M recors. Want to count how many smaller polygons are within populated areas

Depending on the average shape of those Polygons you may see a boost in performance when pre-filtering by the `ST_Centroid` of the public.polys.wkb_geometry:
The idea is to limit the containment check to only those Polygons where at least the `ST_Centroid` intersects the larger Polygon.
Could use `ST_PointOnSurface` too, but this approach only makes sense where the checked polygon is small enough to pass the bbox containment, but outside the actual bounds.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ply.*)
FROM   public.polys AS small
JOIN   public.pop_area AS big
  ON   big.geom ~ small.geom 
 AND   ST_Intersects(big.geom, ST_Centroid( small.geom ))
WHERE  ST_Contains(big.geom, small.geom);
```

### Find Polygons which touch in a line
```sql
WITH 
data(id, geom) AS (VALUES
    ( 1, 'POLYGON ((100 200, 200 200, 200 100, 100 100, 100 200))'::geometry ),
    ( 2, 'POLYGON ((250 150, 200 150, 200 250, 250 250, 250 150))'::geometry ),
    ( 3, 'POLYGON ((300 100, 250 100, 250 150, 300 150, 300 100))'::geometry )
)
SELECT a.id, b.id, 
    ST_Relate(a.geom, b.geom),
    ST_Relate(a.geom, b.geom, '****1****') AS is_line_touch
    FROM data a CROSS JOIN data b WHERE a.id < b.id;
```

### Find Polygons in a Coverage NOT fully enclosed by other Polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/291824/determine-if-a-polygon-is-not-enclosed-by-other-polygons>

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tp5WK.png)

#### Solution
Find polygons where total length of intersection with others is less than length of boundary

```sql
SELECT a.id
FROM data a 
INNER JOIN data b ON (ST_Intersects(a.geom, b.geom) AND a.id != b.id) 
GROUP BY a.id
HAVING 1e-6 > 
  abs(ST_Length(ST_ExteriorRing(a.geom)) - 
  sum(ST_Length(ST_Intersection(ST_Exteriorring(a.geom), ST_ExteriorRing(b.geom)))));
```

### Find Polygons with maximum overlap with another Polygon table

#### Solution with JOIN LATERAL
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/287412/in-postgresql-how-to-get-the-polygon-id-that-intersects-the-most-in-case-it-i>

Example: For each mountain area, find country which has largest overlap.
```sql
SELECT a.id, a.mountain, b.country
FROM mountains a
LEFT JOIN LATERAL
  (SELECT country FROM countrytable
    WHERE ST_Intersects(countrytable.geom, a.geom)
    ORDER BY ST_Area(ST_Intersection(countrytable.geom, a.geom)) DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1
  ) b ON true;
```

#### Solution using DISTINCT ON
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/41501/join-based-on-maximum-overlap-in-postgis-postgresql>

1) Calculate area of intersection for every pair of rows which intersect.
2) Order them by a.id and by intersection area when a.id are equal.
3) For each `a.id` keep the first row (which has the largest intersection area because of ordering in step 2).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (a.id)
  a.id AS a_id,
  b.id AS b_id,
  ST_Area(ST_Intersection( a.geom, b.geom )) AS intersect_area
FROM a, b
WHERE st_intersects( a.geom, b.geom)
ORDER BY a.id, ST_Area(ST_Intersection( a.geom, b.geom )) DESC
```

### Find Polygons intersecting another Polygon table using ST_Subdivide
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/224138/postgis-st-intersects-vs-arcgis-select-by-location>
<https://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2019/11/subdivide.html>

Subdividing Polygons into smaller pieces improves the selectivity of indexes, 
and improves the performance of `ST_Intersects`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE lte_subdivided AS 
SELECT ST_Subdivide(geom) as GEOM, gid
FROM lde_coverage;

CREATE TABLE cities_subdivided AS 
SELECT ST_Subdivide(geom) as GEOM, id
FROM cities;

CREATE INDEX cgx ON cities_subdivided USING GIST (geom);
CREATE INDEX lgx on lte_subdivided USING GIST (geom);

SELECT distinct c.id 
FROM cities_subdivided c
JOIN lte_subdivided l 
ON ST_Intersects(c.geom, l.geom)
```

### Compute hierarchy of a nested Polygonal Coverage
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/343100/intersecting-polygons-to-build-boundary-hierearchy-using-postgis>

Given a table of polygons which form a set of nested/hierarchical coverages, compute an explicit hierachy path for each polygon

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/d8iEG.jpg)

If the source table is:
```
geom of A
geom of AA
geom of AB
geom of AC
geom of AB1
geom of AB2
geom of AC1
geom of AC2
geom of AC11
geom of AC12
geom of AC21
geom of AC22
```
the output will be:
```
AA, A, geom of AA
AB1, AB, A, geom of AB1
AB2, AB, A, geom of AB2
AC11, AC1, AC, A, geom of AC11
AC12, AC1, AC, A, geom of AC12
AC21, AC2, AC, A, geom of AC21
AC22, AC2, AC, A, geom of AC21
```

#### Solution
Determine contains relationships based on interior points and areas. Can use a recursive query on that to extract paths if needed. 

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE data(id, geom) AS (VALUES
('AC11', 'POLYGON ((100 200, 150 200, 150 150, 100 150, 100 200))'),
('AC12', 'POLYGON ((200 200, 200 150, 150 150, 150 200, 200 200))'),
('AC21', 'POLYGON ((200 100, 150 100, 150 150, 200 150, 200 100))'),
('AC22', 'POLYGON ((100 100, 100 150, 150 150, 150 100, 100 100))'),
('AC1', 'POLYGON ((200 200, 200 150, 100 150, 100 200, 200 200))'),
('AC2', 'POLYGON ((200 100, 100 100, 100 150, 200 150, 200 100))'),
('AC', 'POLYGON ((100 200, 200 200, 200 100, 100 100, 100 200))'),
('AB1', 'POLYGON ((100 300, 150 300, 150 200, 100 200, 100 300))'),
('AB2', 'POLYGON ((200 300, 200 200, 150 200, 150 300, 200 300))'),
('AB', 'POLYGON ((100 300, 200 300, 200 200, 100 200, 100 300))'),
('AA', 'POLYGON ((0 300, 100 300, 100 100, 0 100, 0 300))'),
('A', 'POLYGON ((200 100, 0 100, 0 300, 200 300, 200 100))')
),
-- compute all containment links
contains AS ( SELECT p.id idpar, c.id idch, ST_Area(p.geom) par_area
    FROM data p 
    JOIN data c ON ST_Contains(p.geom, ST_PointOnSurface(c.geom))
    WHERE ST_Area(p.geom) > ST_Area(c.geom)
),
-- extract direct containment links, by choosing parent with min area
pcrel AS ( SELECT DISTINCT ON (idch) idpar, idch 
    FROM contains ORDER BY idch, par_area ASC
),
-- compute paths as strings
pcpath(id, path) AS (
    SELECT 'A' AS id, 'A' AS path
    UNION ALL
    SELECT idch AS id, path || ',' || idch
        FROM pcpath JOIN pcrel ON pcpath.id = pcrel.idpar
)
SELECT * FROM pcpath;
```
