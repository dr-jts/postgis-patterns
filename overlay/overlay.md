## Overlay - Overlapping Polygon Dataset

### Create coverage from Nested Polygons

### Create Coverage from Overlapping Polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/83/separate-polygons-based-on-intersection-using-postgis>
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/112498/postgis-overlay-style-union-not-dissolve-style>
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/109692/how-to-replicate-arcgis-intersect-in-postgis>

#### Solution
One answer suggests the standard Extract Lines > Node > Polygonize approach (although does not include the PIP parentage step).  But a comment says that this does not scale well (Pierre Racineâ€¦).

### Count Overlap Depth in set of polygons

<http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2019/07/postgis-overlays.html>

![](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2019/overlays8.png)

Howver, this post indicates this approach might be slow for large datasets:
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/159282/counting-overlapping-polygons-in-postgis-using-st-union-very-slow>

#### Solution
* Extract linework of polygons using `ST_Boundary`
* Compute overlay of dataset using `ST_Union` 
  * sometimes `ST_Node` is suggested, but this does not dissolve linework, which causes problems with polgonization 
* Polygonize linwork using `ST_Polygonize`
* Generate an interior point for each resultant using `ST_PointOnSurface`
* Count resultant overlap depth by joining back to original dataset with `ST_Contains`

### Return only polygons from Overlay
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/89231/postgis-st-intersection-of-polygons-can-return-lines>

<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/242741/st-intersection-returns-erroneous-polygons>

### Compute Coverage from Overlapping Polygons
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/206473/obtaining-each-unique-area-of-overlapping-polygons-in-postgres-9-6-postgis-2-3>

#### Problem
Reduce a dataset of highly overlapping polygons to a coverage (not clear if attribution is needed or not)

#### Issues
User implements a very complex overlay process, but can not get it to work, likely due to robustness problems

#### Solution
`ST_Boundary` -> `ST_Union` -> `ST_Polygonize` ??

## Overlay - Two Polygonal Coverages

### Overlay of two polygon layers - by Intersection

Solution retains all areas from first layer, but not the second:
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/179533/arcgis-union-equivalent-in-postgis>

This has what looks like a complete solution (although complex):
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/401245/getting-the-composite-of-two-polygon-layers<

This answer seems suspect - it may be doing more work than required.

<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/302086/postgis-union-of-two-polygons-layers>

### Overlay of two polygon layers - by Node-Polygonize

* Extract linework using `ST_Boundary`
* Node/dissolve lines using `ST_Union`
  * Sometimes `ST_Node` is suggested, but it does not dissolve duplicate lines 
* Polygonize resultants using `ST_Polygonize`
* Generate an interior point for each resultant using `ST_PointOnSurface`
* Attach parent attribution by joining on interior points using `ST_Contains`

#### Notes
* All intermediate operations are dataset-wide, so materializing as intermediate tables will not improve performance.  That might help with memory usage, however.
* The input tables should have spatial indexes, to improve performance of the final join step
* This approach generalizes nicely to multiple tables,

### Improve performance of a coverage overlay
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/31310/acquiring-arcgis-like-speed-in-postgis>

#### Problem
Finding all intersections of a large set of parcel polygons against a set of jurisdiction polygons is slow

#### Solution
Reduce # calls to ST_Intersection by testing if parcel is wholly contained in polygon. 
```sql
INSERT INTO parcel_jurisdictions(parcel_gid,jurisdiction_gid,isect_geom) 
  SELECT a.orig_gid AS parcel_gid, b.orig_gid AS jurisdiction_gid, 
    CASE 
      WHEN ST_Within(a.geom,b.geom) THEN a.geom 
      ELSE ST_Multi(ST_Intersection(a.geom,b.geom)) 
    END AS geom 
  FROM valid_parcels a 
    JOIN valid_jurisdictions b ON ST_Intersects(a.geom, b.geom);
```
