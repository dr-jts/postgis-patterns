### Split rectangles along North-South axis

### Split Polygons into equal-area parts

Does this really result in equal-area subdivision? The Voronoi-of-centroid step is distance-based, not area basedâ€¦. So may not always work?  Would be good to try this on a bunch of country outines

### Splitting by Line creates narrow gap in Polygonal coverage
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/378705/postgis-splitting-polygon-with-line-returns-different-size-polygons-that-creat>

The cause is that vertex introduced by splitting is not present in adjacent polygon.

* Perhaps differencing splitting line from surrounding intersecting polygon would introduce that vertex?  
* Or is it better to snap surrounding polygons to split vertices? Probably need a complex process to do this - not really something that can be done easily in DB?

### Splitting Polygon creates invalid coverage with holes
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/344716/holes-after-st-split-with-postgis>

#### Solution
None so far. Need some way to create a clean coverage
